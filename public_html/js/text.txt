Free tour means that you can decide the price and the value of the tour when it finishes. We consider it more appropriate for guests to decide the price of the tour according to how much they liked it. It also motivates us to give a good service and improve every day.
We offer tours in Spanish, English and Italian. The tour takes 2 hours approx. Our mission is in a responsive and amusing way to carry enjoyable experience about Malaga and Andalusia, see its genuineness and possibilities for your own escapades and make your adventure unforgettable if you are sharing your impressions with family and friends or travelling on your own.

During our walking tour we will pass by all the most important monuments and sightseeing places in the old town. We will give very significant and interesting information about them. Regrettably, we are not going into any of them for the lack of time and extra ticket costs. However, in the end of the tour you will have all the essential information of what to see so you will be able to visit on your own.

The meeting point at 12:00 PM (noon) is in Plaza de la Constituci√≥n in front of Costa Coffee

We are young people and want to do a lot of activities. Moreover, to meet people from other countries and that they can meet Malaga in a different way.
